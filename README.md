# login-page

To run this Login Page we need to download the html page with pixel.jpeg. After the download create a folder and store the 2 files in it, This helps to run the html page with the jpeg as background. This html page is coded with internal css. The .json & .php files are added to link up this git repo with heroku app. So, just to run the html & jpeg files are enough.
